A showdown looms in the U.S. capitol as the Mayor Muriel Bowser plans weekend anti-racist protests while President Donald Trump continues to push for the policing of the city.

In his latest message on Twitter, President Trump called the Washington DC mayor “incompetent” for pushing back efforts by the federal government to police the capitol’s streets.

“The incompetent Mayor of Washington, D.C., Mayor Bowser, who’s budget is totally out of control and is constantly coming back to us for “handouts”, is now fighting with the National Guard, who saved her from great embarrassment over the last number of nights. If she doesn’t treat these men and women well, then we’ll bring in a different group of men and women!” Trump tweeted on Friday afternoon.
